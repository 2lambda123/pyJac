v1 tasks:
  ☐ Remove separate pressure-dependence function

  ☐ Test Jacobian with PLOG and CHEB reactions
  ☐ strip fortran and matlab code into new branch
misc tasks:
  ☐ Convert all stoich coefficients to float
  ☐ add converter for reactions with units of molecules (rather than moles)
  ☐ Convert reactions with explicit reverse parameters into irreversible reactions for simplicity
  ☐ Convert lists to Numpy arrays
v2:
  ☐ Complete Matlab and Fortran functionality
